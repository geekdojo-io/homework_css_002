CSS is a language that describes the style of an HTML document. You may not know many of CSS properties and syntax, but if you google your questions, you will be able to find all the answers you are looking for.

**What to do:**

- Complete styles.css based on the questions below.

**Homework**

Open the homework-css_002 using `Brackets` app. It should be found in your Linux virtual machine. 
Open the file `dogs/index.html`.
